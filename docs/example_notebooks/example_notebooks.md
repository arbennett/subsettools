CONUS1 Example Notebooks:
The example notebooks in the following section subset datasets from the CONUS1 model stored on Hydrodata.
It is a box domain over the contiguous United States. It does not cover areas near the coasts. This model has 4 soil layers (top 2 meters) and 1 geologic layer that is 100 m thick. The cell size is 1 kilometer. For more information about the CONUS1 domain and simulations please refer to the following (ADD PUBLICATIONS)

CONUS2 Example Notebooks:
The following example notebooks subset datasets from the CONUS2 model stored on Hydrodata.The CONUS2 modeling domain covers all areas of the contiguous United States. The model has 4 soil and 6 geologic layers. The cell size is 1 kilometer. For more information about the CONUS2 domain and simulations, refer to (PUBLICATIONS).
